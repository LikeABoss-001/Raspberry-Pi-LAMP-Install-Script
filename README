<h1>Raspberry Pi LAMP Install Script</h1>
<p>If you were using Ubuntu Server on your Pi, to install a LAMP (Linux, Apache, PHP, and MySQL), you would simply type </p> <code>sudo tasksel install lamp-server</code><p>, but that doesn't work on the Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>With this script, installation is simple, and reduces dozens of commands into a simple script.</p>

<h3>Installation Proceedure:</h3>
<code>
git clone <URL>
cd Raspberry-pi-LAMP-Install-Script
sudo bash install.sh
</code>
