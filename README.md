<h1>Raspberry Pi LAMP Install Script</h1>
<p>If you were using Ubuntu Server on your Pi, to install a LAMP (Linux, Apache, PHP, and MySQL), you would simply type one command using <code>tasksel</code>, but that doesn't work on the Raspberry Pi.  With this script, installation is simple, and reduces dozens of commands into a simple script.</p>

<h3>Installation Proceedure:</h3>

<code>git clone https://github.com/LikeABoss-001/Raspberry-Pi-LAMP-Install-Script.git
cd Raspberry-pi-LAMP-Install-Script
sudo bash install.sh</code>
